  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is <strong><u>
  the standard markup language for documents </strong></u>designed to be displayed in a web browser.
  <br>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
  <br>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
  HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
  <p><img src="example1.jpg" width='40%'</p>
  <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
  into the rendered page. <br>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
  such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
  Tags such as (img/) and (input/) directly introduce content into the page. <br>Other tags such as (p) surround and provide information
  about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. <br>Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
  but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
